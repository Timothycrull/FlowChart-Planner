# FlowChart-Planner
The goal was to make a planner that acts like a flow chart maker. you can move the shapes around and insert text into them. 

The main problem I had while making it was the text not moving with the shapes when the shapes were dragged.
To fix this you can drag the insert text prompt wherever you want the text to be and it will spawn in where the prompt was.

The buttons at the bottom spawn in the shapes and will prompt you with a text box. The text will spawn under the shape. 

If the line button is pressed it will spawn in a line to connect the tasks you write in the shapes. The lines however do move as intended and you can move both sides to where they are needed.
